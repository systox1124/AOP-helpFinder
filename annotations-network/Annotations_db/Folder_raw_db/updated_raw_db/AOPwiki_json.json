Farm workers exposed with commonly used OP showed sharp decrease in blood AChE (MIE) level simultaneously over expression of CYP2E1 (KE1) at mRNA level (Sharma RK et al., 2013). CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress (KE2) by over activation of JNK signaling (Schattenberg JM et al., 2014). Literature further supported that oxidative stress causes neurodegeneration (KE3) by targeting different cellular macromolecules including membrane lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidation of protein and nucleic acid (Gandhi S et al., 2012). Thus neurodegeneration and oxidative stress are inherently related phenomena, since microglia and astrocytes are the main sources of reactive oxygen species in CNS degenerative disorders consequently oxidative stress in brain caused neurodegeneration (Mendonca HR et al., 2020, Wakatsuki S et al., 2015, Mishra V et al., 2015, Kim M et al., 2019). Neurodegeneration leads to impairment of retrograde axonal transport that prohibits the growth factor supply to long-range projection neurons, causing synapse loss, and post-synaptic dendrite retraction that leads to decrease of the neuronal network in adult brain (KE 4) (aopwiki.org/relationships/647, Seeley WW et al., 2009). Palop et al (2006) also advocated that neurodegeneration leads to neural network dysfunction. Consequently, loss of neuronal network function in adult brain leads to an important adverse outcome sensory axonal peripheral neuropathy and symptoms include numbness, lack of coordination, impairment of motor nerve, dizziness, burning sensation etc. (\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color:white\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Times New Roman\u0026quot;,serif\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#212121\"\u003eDiantonio et al., 2019, Valek L et al., 2019, Persson AK et al., 2016, Topp KS et al., 2000).

The MIE was identified as \u0026quot;\u0026nbsp;DNA topoisomerase II poisons (interfers with) topo II enzyme\u0026quot; and\u0026nbsp;epidemiological studies suggest\u0026nbsp;that\u0026nbsp; exposure to topoisomerases II poisons\u0026nbsp;may be involved in generation of the two\u0026nbsp;KEs, DNA double strand break and\u0026nbsp;MLL chromosomal rearrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, based on the available evidence, infant leukaemia pathogenesis originates from a single, severe hit to a target cell during early intrauterine development. Whereas the limited epidemiological studies do not allow any firm conclusion on a possible role for chemicals in infant leukaemia (Pombo-de-Oliveira et al 2006; Ferreira et al 2013), exposures to chemicals able to induce MLL rearrangements through topoisomerase II (TopoII) \u0026ldquo;poison\u0026rdquo;, particularly etoposide and other TopoII \u0026ldquo;poisons\u0026rdquo;, including some bioflavonoids, have been suggested as agents promoting the driving\u0026nbsp;genetic oncogenic event. Experimental models for infant leukaemia have been developed, but a wholly satisfactory model reproducing the phenotype and latency is not yet available.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, the anticancer drug etoposide can be considered as a model chemical for DNA topoisomerase \u0026ldquo;poison\u0026rdquo;. Acute leukaemia is an adverse effect recorded in etoposide-treated patients, showing MLL rearrangements that are in many ways analogous to those in infant leukaemia (Bueno et al 2009; Joannides et al 2010, 2011). Therefore, the proposed AOP is supported by a number of convincing inferential evidences by means of using etoposide as a model\u0026nbsp;compound to empirically support the linkage between the proposed molecular initiating event (MIE) and the adverse outcome (AO). In the meanwhile, this AOP identifies several knowledge gaps, the main ones being the identification of the initiating cell and the investigation of TopoII poisons in a robust model; thus, the present AOP may be modified in future on the basis of new evidence. The authors recognize that additional elements are limiting the strenght of this AOP. Although a strong empirical support exists for the direct link between the MIE and the DNA double strand break and between this KE and the MLL translocation,\u0026nbsp;the empirical support for the indirect link between MLL translocation and the AO is mainly based on one chemical stressor and that essentiality data are also limited and difficult to generate.\u0026nbsp;T\u003cspan style=\"font-size:18px\"\u003ehe biological plausibility\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Calibri\u0026quot;,sans-serif\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;for the KERs is considered high\u0026nbsp;for the initial step but is only moderate for the final step because of the uncertainties associated with lack of knowledge in the final step of the disease and lack of appropriate models able to fully recapitulate the disease.

In molluscs, serotonergic neurons are responsible for the termination of the catch state of muscle contraction (Muneoka and Twarog, 1983). During catch, muscles contract and are resistant to stretch well after excitation by acetylcholine has stopped and intracellular Ca2+ stores return to normal. Importantly, this prolonged contraction is accomplished with minimal (or no) use of energy. While additional phyla may also be able to undergo catch contraction, the role of serotonin in releasing the contraction state appears to be unique to mollusks (Muneoka and Twarog, 1983). In bivalves, catch is used to maintain valve (shell) closure and the presence of serotonin promotes the transition from the passive state to active valve movement; exposure to 5-HTT inhibitors has been observed to cause increased valve movement in swan mussels (Cunha and Machado, 2001). Increased valve movement not only depletes the organism\u0026rsquo;s energy reserves,but can cause excess water retention in the foot. This water retention is speculated to cause the foot detachment observed in mussels exposed to 5-HTT inhibitors (Cunha and Machado, 2001), although terrestrial gastropods also experience foot detachement (Pavlova 2001). Mussels in the unattached state expend greater energy [54] and are more susceptibility to predation than those attached to a substrate and clumped together (Casey and Chattopadhyay, 2008).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSerotonin has also been identified as a primary neurotransmitter used to control both ciliary and pedal foot locomotion in land and aquatic mollusks (Muneoka et al 1983, Pavlova 2001 , Gosselin 1961, Longley 2010). The specific impacts on locomotion, as well as the concentration-dependence, varies among molluscs because of differing physiology and life history strategies (Fong, 2014). In\u0026nbsp;various\u0026nbsp;bivalves, movement alterations may take the form of increased valve movement, locomotion and mantle display, and/or increased burrowing or burrowing (inappropriately) during daylight hours. The untimely and excessive movement of molluscs due to amplified serotonergic activity could feasibly enhance their visibility and/or diminish their energy reserves, making them more susceptible to predation. Recently, prolonged, low-dose (30-300 ng/L) exposures of mussels to fluoxetine were reported to cause decreases in filter feeding rates, energy reserves and growth (Peters 2016). Foot detachment mentioned above has also been attributed to disrupted coordination of pedal muscle cells and ciliated epithelium of the foot (Pavlova 2001).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":120,"created_at":"2015-03-26T12:07:40.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-02-08T14:04:58.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/97.json"},{"id":195,"title":"5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (5-HTT) inhibition leading to population increase","short_name":"5-HTT leading to population increase","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eIncreased serotonergic activity resulting from the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamin transporter (5-HTT; SERT; serotonin reuptake transporter) may result in increased population levels of certain mollusks, specifically invasive mussels.

DHT is more potent agonist of the Androgen receptor (AR) than testosterone, so that DHT is necessary for proper masculinization of e.g. male external genitalia. Under normal physiological conditions, testosterone produced mainly by the testicles, is converted in peripheral tissues by 5\u0026alpha;-reductase into DHT, which in turn binds AR and activates downstream target genes. AR signaling is necessary for masculinization of the developing fetus, including differentiation of the levator ani/bulbocavernosus (LABC) muscle complex in males. The LABC complex does not develop in the absence, or low levels of, androgen signaling, as in female fetuses.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe key events in this pathway is inhibition of 5\u0026alpha;-reductase that converts testosterone into the more potent DHT in androgen sensitive target tissues.

Aging and genetics are important risk factors, but systemic and environmental factors contribute to this risk in a still poorly understood way. Within the frame of BioMed21, the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) concept for toxicology was recommended as a tool for enhancing human disease research and accelerating translation of data into human applications. Its potential to capture biological knowledge and to increase mechanistic understanding about human diseases has been substantiated since. In pursuit of the tau-cascade hypothesis, a tau-driven AOP blueprint toward the adverse outcome of memory loss is proposed. Sequences of key events and plausible key event relationships, triggered by the bidirectional relationship between brain cholesterol and glucose dysmetabolism, and contributing to memory loss are captured. To portray how environmental factors may contribute to sAD progression, information on chemicals and drugs, that experimentally or epidemiologically associate with the risk of AD and mechanistically link to sAD progression, are mapped on this AOP. The evidence suggests that chemicals may accelerate disease progression by plugging into sAD relevant processes. The proposed AOP is a simpliﬁed framework of key events and plausible key event relationships representing one speciﬁc aspect of sAD pathology, and an attempt to portray chemical interference. Other sAD-related AOPs (e.g., A-beta-driven AOP) and a better understanding of the impact of aging and genetic polymorphism are needed to further expand our mechanistic understanding of early AD pathology and the potential impact of environmental and systemic risk factors.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":11,"created_at":"2014-02-12T09:36:29.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-05-09T02:52:36.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/429.json"},{"id":82,"title":"Abnormal role change in worker caste contributes to reduced brood care and leads to colony loss/failure","short_name":"Chane in caste - Colony loss","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":198,"created_at":"2014-01-14T10:26:18.000-05:00","updated_at":"2024-03-06T12:25:45.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/82.json"},{"id":427,"title":"ACE2 downregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers dysregulation of RAAS and can lead to heart failure.","short_name":"Downregulation of ACE2 causes multi-factorial heart injury and heart failure.","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":4405,"created_at":"2021-04-06T10:08:28.000-04:00","updated_at":"2023-01-11T16:32:15.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/427.json"},{"id":16,"title":"Acetylcholinesterase inhibition leading to acute mortality","short_name":"AChE inhibition - acute mortality","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThe contents of this AOP page represent an interconnected network of AOPs linking the MIE of acetylcholinesterase inhibition to the AO of acute mortality. Both AOPs include the KE of acetylcholine accumulation at the synapses, which results in excessive signaling from cholinergic neurons on a broad range of tissues throughout the body. Respiratory failure is the predominant mechanism leading to acute mortality in humans (Satoh, 2006). While these two AOPs are represented on the basis of their most plausible linkages to acute mortality, other known symptoms of acetylcholinesterase inhibition mediated through actions on other receptors and tissues may also play a role (see Russom et al. 2014). Overall, there is strong evidence supporting the linkage of acetylcholinesterase inhibition and acetylcholine accumulation with acute mortality, but the precise contribution of the different organ-level effects across different species isn\u0026rsquo;t completely understood. This network of AOPs as a whole, including the indirect KERs depicted, supports the potential utility of in vitro or short-term in vivo measures of acetylcholinesterase inhibition for identifying chemicals with potential to cause acute mortality across a broad range of species. Caution is needed when interpreting the in vitro results, however, because well known chemical initiators of these AOPs are known to require metabolic activation, which can result in false negatives. In contrast, detoxification of these compounds is sometimes deficient in the young resulting in life stage differences in response to different chemicals that act through this mechanism. Toxicokinetics is also variable across species making this a major determinant of species sensitivity. At present, quantitative understanding is not sufficiently complete to accurately predict apical outcomes or potency from in vitro measurements alone, and the chemical-specific ADME and toxicokinetic considerations will be strong determinant of quantitative outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":313,"created_at":"2013-05-02T08:44:29.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-03-07T09:13:51.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/16.json"},{"id":312,"title":"Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition leading to Acute Mortality via Impaired Coordination \u0026 Movement​","short_name":"AChE inhibition - acute mortality via predation","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":192,"created_at":"2013-08-13T11:01:07.000-04:00","updated_at":"2023-02-22T18:34:26.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/312.json"},{"id":281,"title":"Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition Leading to Neurodegeneration","short_name":"AChE Inhibition Leading to Neurodegeneration","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThe enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) hydrolyzes acetylcholine (ACh) in order to eliminate it from the body.\u0026nbsp; When AChE is inhibited ACh levels increase.

Oxidative stress responses elicit further endothelial dysfunction (KE2). This impairs the endothelium readily causing the penetration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) into the intima, which is directly oxidized by ROS, forming oxidized LDL (KE5). The impaired endothelium has an increased expression of adhesion molecules, which recruit blood monocytes, which adhere and then infiltrate into the intima region (KE3). The microenvironment of the impaired endothelium induces the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages (KE4). Macrophages in the intima uptake oxidized LDL intracellularly, forming foam cells (KE6) and the accumulation of lipid-rich foam cells and their debris after necrosis form plaques (i.e., lipid core, KE7)). These conditions promote the migration of fibroblasts and trans-differentiation of smooth muscle cells into myofibroblasts, which form a fibrous cap on the apical side of the plaque (KE7). Then, the increased expression of collagenase causes thinning of the fibrous cap by the degradation of collagen in the fibrous cap (KE8). These plaques are unstable and this eventually leads to rapture. The aggregation of platelets occurs around the raptured endothelium leading to the formation of three-dimensional clots (i.e. thrombosis, AO).\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":9215,"created_at":"2022-03-01T01:45:21.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-08-30T18:39:51.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/462.json"},{"id":439,"title":"Activation of the AhR leading to metastatic breast cancer ","short_name":"AhR activation to metastatic breast cancer","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eBreast cancer is the deadliest cancer in women with a poor prognosis in case of metastatic breast cancer.

style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"\u003eIn this AOP, the primary trigger for a compound to be considered with respect to potential to create photochemical and photobiological reactions is the absorption of photon energy from light ranging from 290 to 700 nm.\u0026nbsp; The extent of absorption depends on the wavelength of light and the type of absorbing chromophores in the light-exposed tissues. \u0026nbsp;A molecule is excited by absorption of photon energy, and the photoactivated molecule induces photochemical reactions via energy transfer (type I photochemical reaction) and free radical generation (type II photochemical reaction).\u0026nbsp; These photochemical reactions result in generation of radicals and reactive oxygen species, and the reactive species react with biomolecules.\u0026nbsp; Generated radicals of a target chemical bind to DNA and proteins, resulting in formation of these photo-adducts, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), including singlet oxygen and superoxide, induce oxidation of biomolecules.\u0026nbsp; These key events bring inflammatory events in the light-exposed tissues \u003c!--[if supportFields]\u003e\u003cspan

DEHP is often found in freshwater ecosystems and many freshwater species have been exposed to natural aquatic systems. ADH is a metabolizing enzyme produced in response to exposure to DEHP. ADH could increase estrogen levels. It causes gynaecological cancers and reproductive dysfunction.

However, germ cell mutation analysis has been hampered by a lack of efficient tools. With the publication of the OECD test guideline TG488 (rodent transgene mutation assay) and new technologies (including next generation sequencing) this field is experiencing renewed focus. Indeed, regulatory approaches to assess germ cell mutagenicity were the focus of an IWGT workshop (Yauk et al., 2013). Of particular concern is the inability to address this endpoint through high-throughput screening assays (because spermatogenesis cannot be carried out in culture), and mutagenesis is an important gap in existing high-throughput tests. The motivation for developing this AOP was to provide context for new assays in this field, identify research gaps and facilitate the development of new methods.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn this AOP, a compound capable of alkylating DNA is delivered to the testes causing germ cell mutations and subsequent mutations in the offspring of the exposed parents. The AOP requires uptake of the parent compound or metabolite in spermatogonia and interaction with DNA in those cells. DNA alkylation in male pre-meiotic germ cells is the molecular initiating event. A variety of different DNA adducts are formed that are subject to DNA repair; however, at high doses the repair machinery becomes saturated or overwhelmed. The fate of remaining adducts includes: (1) attempted DNA repair by alternative DNA repair machinery, or (2) no repair. Key event (KE) 1 is insufficient or incorrect DNA repair. Lack of repair can lead to replication of adducted DNA and ensuing mutations in male pre-meiotic germ cells (KE2). Mutations that do not impair spermatogenic processes will persist in these cells and eventually be present in the mature sperm. Thus, the mutations can be transmitted to the offspring (adverse outcome \u0026ndash; inherited mutations). It is well documented that mice and other animals exposed to alkylating agents develop mutations in male pre-meiotic germ cells that are then found in sperm, resulting in the transmission of mutations to their offspring. There is a significant amount of empirical evidence supporting the AOP and the overall weight of evidence is strong. Although there are some gaps surrounding some mechanistic aspects of this AOP, the overarching AOP is widely accepted and applies broadly to any species that produces sperm.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":61,"created_at":"2013-12-16T13:44:19.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-01-09T20:14:28.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/15.json"},{"id":139,"title":"Alkylation of DNA leading to cancer 1","short_name":"DNA alkylation -\u003e cancer 1","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":61,"created_at":"2013-12-16T13:44:19.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-01-09T20:14:28.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/139.json"},{"id":322,"title":"Alkylation of DNA leading to reduced sperm count","short_name":"Alkylation of DNA leading to reduced sperm count","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":61,"created_at":"2013-12-16T13:44:19.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-01-09T20:14:28.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/322.json"},{"id":126,"title":"Alpha-noradrenergic antagonism leads to reduced fecundity via delayed ovulation","short_name":"α-noradrenergic- reduced fecundity","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":290,"created_at":"2015-03-16T15:56:10.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T09:39:50.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/126.json"},{"id":105,"title":"Alpha2u-microglobulin cytotoxicity leading to renal tubular adenomas and carcinomas (in male rat)","short_name":"α2u-globulin- renal adenomas/carcinomas","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP) outlines potential key events leading to a tumor outcome in standard carcinogenicity models.

The AR is involved in the mediation of various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in many tissues. The two main events regulated by AR mediated gene expression are urogenital tract differentiation during gestation and sexual changes during puberty. The AR can be activated by the binding of the endogenous androgens testosterone and its metabolite 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which can activate gene expression at the transcription level. In mammals, virilisation of the external genitalia is driven by DHT while the differentiation of the Wolffian duct is driven by testosterone. Chemicals which bind to the AR may cause disruption by agonism, antagonism or by both mechanisms.

The AOP is likely to be synergized during fasting, starvation or malnutrition events.\u0026nbsp; The MIE for this AOP involves antagonistic PPAR\u0026alpha; binding. The antagonist-binding to the PPAR\u0026alpha; regulatory complex causes the KE1, stabilization of co-repressor (SMRT or N-CoR) to PPARalpha ligand binding domain suppressing PPAR\u0026alpha; nuclear signaling (Nagy et al 1999, Xu et al 2002). PPAR\u0026alpha; is a transcriptional regulator for a variety of genes that facilitate systemic energy homeostasis (Mirza et al 2019, Kersten 2014, Evans et al 2004, Desvergne and Wahli 1999). As a result of the MIE and then KE1, the KE2 occurs where PPARalpha transactivation is inhibited for genes involved in the next 2 key events of the AOP: (KE3) decreased fatty acid beta oxidation (Desvergne and Wahili 1999, Kersten 2014, Dreyer et al 1992, Lazarow 1978, Brandt et al 1998; Mascaro et al 1998, Aoyama et al 1998, Gulick et al 1994, Sanderson et al 2008) and (KE4) decreased ketogenesis (Cahil 2006, Kersten et al 2014, Sengupta et al 2010, Desvergne and Wahli 1999). The KE3 results in decreased catabolism of very long chain fatty acids in peroxisomes and reduced catabolism of long, medium and short chain fatty acids in mitochondria reducing acetyl-CoA availability for use in oxidative phosphorylation-based ATP production (Evans et al 2004).\u0026nbsp; KE2 (and also potentially KE3) can drive KE4 resulting in decreased potential to repackage energy substrates as ketone bodies to support systemic energy demands during periods where the systemic energy budget is negative (Badman et al 2007, Potthoff 2009; Muoio et al 2002). The KE5, no change or a decrease in circulating ketone bodies becomes critical during cellular energy deficit conditions, a state where ketogenesis is typically induced to increase circulating ketone bodies providing metabolic fuel to sustain energy homeostasis (Cahill 2006). Physiological studies of the progression of human starvation have demonstrated the critical importance of ketogenesis, especially production of \u0026beta;-hydroxybutyrate, for meeting systemic energy demands by supplementing glucose to sustain the energy requirements of the brain (Cahill 2006, Owen et al 2005). PPAR\u0026alpha; knock can inhibit ketogenesis from fatty acid substrates in fasted mice reducing \u0026beta;-hydroxybutyrate production causing hypoketonemia (Badman et al 2007, Le May et al 2000, Muoio et al 2002).\u0026nbsp; Sustained negative energy budgets lead to KE6, an increase in muscle protein catabolism, with glutamine and alanine recycled for gluconeogenesis (Felig et al 1970A, Kashiwaya et al 1994). \u0026nbsp;If ketogenesis from fatty acid substrates fails to meet cellular energy needs, gluconeogenesis from alternative substrates becomes necessary including (KE 6) muscle protein catabolism \u003cem\u003ein situ\u003c/em\u003e supporting local muscle function and releasing glutamine (Marliss et al 1971) and alanine (Felig et al 1970A) for gluconeogenesis in kidney and liver to sustain systemic energy needs (Goodman et al 1966, Kashiwaya et al 1994, Cahill 2006).\u0026nbsp; Finally, the AO of body-weight loss occurs, which within the context of dynamic energy budget theory, decreases energy allocations to organismal maturation and reproduction (Nisbet et al 2000) and has been demonstrated to negatively affect ecological fitness (Martin et al 1987).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":329,"created_at":"2013-05-02T11:21:53.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T09:40:09.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/6.json"},{"id":170,"title":"Anti-dopaminergic activity leading to mammary adenomas and carcinomas in the SD rat","short_name":"Anti-dopaminergic activity and mammary tumors","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP) outlines potential key events leading to a tumor outcome in standard carcinogenicity models.

These planar compounds are able to bind to the AhR causing\u0026nbsp;heterodimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT) and interaction with dioxin-responsive elements on the DNA causing an up-regulation in dioxin responsive genes. Hundreds to thousands of genes are regulated, either directly or indirectly, by the AhR. One dioxin-responsive gene is cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) which has roles in development of the cardiovascular system. Up-regulation in expression of COX-2 causes alteration in cardiovascular development and function which results in reduced heart pumping efficiency, reduced blood flow, and eventual cardiac collapse and death. Comparable apical manifestations of activation of the AhR have been recorded across freshwater and marine teleost and non-teleost fishes, as well as birds.

There have been numerous proposed mechanisms of action for this toxicity profile, many of which include the dysregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a key event, as it is essential for normal vasculogenesis and therefore cardiogenesis (Ivnitski-Steele and Walker 2005). This AOP describes the indirect suppression of VEGF expression through the sequestration of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) by AHR. ARNT is common dimerization partner for both AHR and hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-1\u0026alpha;), which stimulates angiogenesis through the transcriptional regulation of VEGF (Ivnitski-Steele and Walker 2005).\u0026nbsp; There is considerable cross talk between these two signaling pathways (AHR and HIF-1\u0026alpha;), leading to the hypothesis that AHR activation leads to sustained AHR/ARNT dimerization and reduced HIF-1\u0026alpha;/ARNT dimerization, preventing the adequate transcription of essential angiogenic factors, such as VEGF.

However, sustained (direct or indirect) over-activation of these receptors can induce excitotoxic neuronal cell death. Indeed, mainly increased Ca2+ influx through NMDARs promotes many pathways of toxicity due to generation of free radical species, reduced ATP production, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein aggregation. Neuronal injury induced by over-activation of these receptors and the excessive Ca2+ influx is considered an early key event of excitotoxicity. Additionally, the excessive activation of NMDARs has been found to play a significant role in a variety of neurological disorders ranging from acute hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (Barenger et al., 2001) to chronic neurodegenerative diseases (Mehta et al., 2013). The proposed AOP is relevant to adult neurotoxicity testing. A molecular initiating event (MIE) has been defined as a direct binding of agonists to NMDARs or indirect, through prior activation of AMPARs and/or KARs resulting in sustained NMDARs over-activation causing excitotoxic neuronal cell death, mainly in hippocampus and cortex, two brain structures fundamental for learning and memory processes. The AOP is based on the empirical support describing (1) domoic acid (DomA) induced excitotoxicity triggered by indirect (through KARs/AMPARs) NMDARs over-activation leading to impaired learning and memory and (2) glufosinate (GLF) induced excitotoxicity that through direct binding to NMDARs causes convulsions and memory loss (Lanz et al., 2014). GLF is the methylphosphine analog of L-glutamate, used as a component of bactericidal and fungicidal herbicidal. DomA, a natural toxin that accumulates in mussels and shellfish is also an analogue of L-glutamate and among the most prominent features described after human exposure to DomA is memory impairment (Lefebvre and Robertson, 2010). DomA and GLF are described as the examples of the stressors due to large amounts of published data (especially in the case of DomA), however this AOP is relevant to any agonist that directly or indirectly cause NMDARs over-activation. Some of the known agonists selective for the NMDARs are derived from the naturally occurring amino acids such as ibotenic acid, homocysteine and l-aspartate and polyamines like spermidine.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":30,"created_at":"2014-07-03T10:01:13.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T09:40:29.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/48.json"},{"id":475,"title":"Binding of chemicals to ionotropic glutamate receptors leads to impairment of learning and memory via loss of drebrin from dendritic spines of neurons","short_name":"IGR binding leads to impairment of learning and memory (via loss of drebrin)","abstract":"\u003cdiv\u003e\r\n\u003ctable align=\"left\"\u003e\r\n\t\u003ctbody\u003e\r\n\t\t\u003ctr\u003e\r\n\t\t\t\u003ctd style=\"vertical-align:top\"\u003e\r\n\t\t\t\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:11pt\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Times New Roman\u0026quot;,serif\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Arial\u0026quot;,sans-serif\"\u003eNeurotoxicity risk assessment is an important issue for regulatory agencies.

Binding to SH-/ seleno-proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress has been defined as the Molecular Initiating Event (MIE). Production, binding and degradation of Reactive Oxygen Radicals (ROS) are tightly regulated, and an imbalance between production and protection may cause oxidative stress, which is common to many toxicity pathways. Oxidative stress may lead to an imbalance in glutamate neurotransmission, which is involved in learning and memory. Oxidative stress may also cause cellular injury and death. During brain development and in particular during the establishment of neuronal connections and networks, such perturbations may lead to functional impairment in learning and memory. Neuroinflammation (Resident cell activation; Increased pro-inflammatory mediators) is triggered early in cell injury cascades and is considered as an exacerbating factor. The weight-of-evidence supporting the relationship between the described key events is based mainly on developmental effects observed after an exposure to the heavy metal, mercury, known for its strong affinity to many SH-/seleno-containing proteins, but in particular to those having anti-oxidant properties, such as glutathione (GSH). The overall assessment of this AOP is considered as strong, based on the biological plausibility, the empirical support and on the essentiality of the Key Events (KEs), which are moderate to strong, since blocking, preventing or attenuating an upstream KE is mitigating the downstream KE.

To understand and find a way of the COVID-19 treatment, the signaling pathway and therapeutic mechanism of COVID-19 should be investigated. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 includes molecular networks such as the binding of the membrane proteins, signaling pathways, and RNA replication. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a new type of coronavirus causing COVID-19, infects the cells via the binding of the membrane proteins of human cells and is internalized by the cells.

As a result, the first key event (KE)\u0026nbsp;is a decrease in inward chloride conductance through the ligand-gated ion channel. This leads to the second KE, a reduction in postsynaptic inhibition, reflected as reduced frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) or abolishment of GABA-induced firing action in GABAergic neuronal membranes. Consequently, the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire is decreased, resulting in the generation of a large excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), i.e., the third KE.\u0026nbsp;The large EPSP is reflected as a\u0026nbsp;spike (rise) of intracellular Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e observed in the affected region, where a large group of excitatory neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner.

The etiology of\u0026nbsp; neural tube defects (NTDs) is not fully understood, but many studies highlight the role of environmental factors, in addition to genetic risks (Finnell et al., 2021; Isaković et al., 2022). Higher incidence of NTDs was observed in regions where higher frequency of fumonisin FB1 in maize was also reported (Hendricks, 1999; Marasas et al., 2004; Moore et al., 1997). This circumstantial evidence suggests possible associations between FB1 exposure and NTDs, that are further supported by a case-control study in human and several animal studies (Gelineau-Van Waes et al., 2005; Marasas et al., 2004; Missmer et al., 2006; Voss et al., 2014). FB1 is a well established inhibitor of the ceramide synthase (CerS) (Wang et al., 1991), a central enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism. This AOP has therefore been developped to depict the key events leading from CerS inhibition and perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism to NTDs (van den Brand et al., 2022). It is largely based on the mode of action description in the EFSA Scientific opinion on fumonisins (EFSA et al., 2018) and proposes two routes. The first route involves effects on folate uptake - the role of folate in preventing NTDs is known and very well supported by many studies (Wahbeh and Manyama, 2021). The other route involves the inhibition of histone deacethylase (HDAC) - the key events leading from HDAC inhibition to NTDs are described in the AOP 275. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":459,"created_at":"2017-07-18T07:11:30.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-03-31T09:00:13.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/449.json"},{"id":106,"title":"Chemical binding to tubulin in oocytes leading to aneuploid offspring","short_name":"Tubulin binding and aneuploidy","abstract":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:12px\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"\u003eAneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, arising during meiosis in germ cells represents the most common chromosomal abnormality at birth and is the leading cause of pregnancy loss in humans. Aneuploidy can affect any chromosome, and data in rodents suggest that neither aneuploid sperm nor aneuploid oocytes are selected against at fertilization. Therefore, an increase in germ cell aneuploidy is expected to result in an increase in aneuploid pregnancies. The etiology of human aneuploidy is still not well understood, although there is strong evidence supporting a preferential occurrence during female meiosis I and a positive correlation with maternal age. There is extensive evidence in animal models that chemicals can induce aneuploidy by interfering with the proper functioning of the meiotic spindle and other aspects of chromosome segregation. Over 15 chemicals have been shown to induce aneuploidy in mammalian oocytes and the majority of these chemicals interfere with microtubule dynamics during meiosis. In addition to these animal studies, there is also one reported case in which environmental exposure to trichlorfon, an organophosphate insecticide, was associated with a cluster of Down syndrome cases among women in a Hungarian community. The present AOP focuses on the induction of aneuploidy in mammalian oocytes as a consequence of chemical binding to tubulin (MIE). In this AOP, chemicals that bind to tubulin lead to the depolymerization of microtubules (KE1). Extensive microtubule depolymerization leads to meiotic spindle disorganization (KE2), which in turns lead to altered chromosome dynamics (KE3) and the generation of aneuploid oocytes (KE4). Aneuploid oocytes can be fertilized and generate aneuploid offspring (AO).

Successful molting, and therefore a successful development necessitates stability and integrity of the cuticle to support muscular contractions involved in the shedding of the old cuticle. The integrity of the cuticle is largely dependent on the \u003cem\u003eN\u003c/em\u003e-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) polymer chitin. Therefore, arthropods heavily rely on chitin synthesis as chitin is one of the main constituents of the cuticle. The cuticular chitin synthase (CHS-1) is the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway and arthropods are therefore especially dependent on its proper function. The present AOP describes the effects of chemical inhibition of the cuticular chitin synthase (CHS-1) on the molting process leading to increased mortality in arthropods. Inhibition of CHS-1 is the molecular initiating event and leads to a decreased chitin content in the arthropod cuticle which leaves the organism immature at the stage for ecdysis. This phenomenon can be described as premature molting. The organism eventually dies due to being stuck in the old cuticle or due to the consequences of a weak exoskeleton after ecdysis. The AOP is considered to be very consistent. Essentiality of key events was rated as high for every key event and the biological plausibility was rated as high for the whole AOP. However, there does not exist very much empirical evidence that allows to draw a representative conclusion on dose concordance along the AOP whereas time concordance can be supported by knockdown studies of CHS-1. Therefore, empirical evidence was considered to be moderate and the quantitative understanding was considered to be low. The overall confidence in the AOP was valued as moderate.

Both animal and human studies investigating NMDA itself, experiments with NMDAR antagonists and mutant mice lacking NMDAR subunits strongly support this statement (Rezvani, 2006). Activation of NMDARs results in long-term potentiation (LTP), which is related to increased synaptic strength, plasticity and memory formation in the hippocampus (Johnston et al., 2009). LTP induced by activation of NMDA receptors has been found to be elevated in the developing rodent brain compared to the mature brain, partially due to \u0026#39;developmental switch\u0026#39; of the NMDAR 2A and 2B subunits (Johnston et al., 2009). Activation of the NMDAR also enhances brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, which promotes neuronal survival, differentiation and synaptogenesis (Tyler et al., 2002; Johnston et al., 2009). Consequently, the blockage of NMDAR by chemical substances during synaptogenesis disrupts neuronal network formation resulting in the impairment of learning and memory processes (Toscano and Guilarte, 2005).

The molecular initiating event (MIE) is activation of the CAR nuclear receptor, either by direct binding of a ligand or by an indirect mechanism (e.g. as with phenobarbital), both of which allow the CAR protein to translocate to\u0026nbsp;the nucleus and alter expression of CAR target genes. In rats and mice, CAR activation alters the expression of certain genes related to cell cycle control, producing changes resulting in a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic environment.

Protein adduct formation is the interaction between a chemical, or reactive metabolite, and a protein at molecular level. During this interaction a covalent bond is formed which occurs due to the reaction between an electrophilic chemical and the nucleophilic part of a protein. When a chemical forms a covalent bond with a protein the protein is damaged and can loses its function. Acetaldehyde, the metabolite of ethanol, is also one of these chemicals known to form protein adducts. This is why protein adduct formation is added in this AOP based on ethanol. CYP2E1 is one of the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of ethanol, and because of this metabolic activity the MIE in added in this AOP. CYP2E1 participates in the metabolism of endogenous, small and hydrophobic compounds using a oxidation reaction. CYP2E1 is mainly expressed in rat liver cells, but can also be found in rat brain cells. Furthermore, in the human brain CYP2E1 expression is mainly found in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. At higher concentrations of ethanol the expression of CYP2E1 increases, as well as the activity of CYP2E1 since it has a relatively high Km value for ethanol. In this AOP\u0026nbsp;four different KEs are used, which are oxidative stress (KE1), lipid peroxidation (KE2), unfolded protein response (UPR) (KE3) and apoptosis (KE4). Oxidative stress can be defined as the imbalance between ROS and defence mechanisms against these ROS. ROS levels in a cell can rise which leads to damage by the oxidizing free radicals. Lipid peroxidation is a form of direct damage to lipids in the cell membrane or organelle membranes. The cell membrane will eventually break due to the build-up of all the damage. MDA\u0026nbsp; and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) are two products of lipid peroxidation. UPR is a reaction activated by stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress can be induced by too much protein folding which reaches a higher level than the folding capacity. Also accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER and protein adducts formation with important endoplasmic proteins can induce ER stress, which activates UPR.

Substrates are low molecular weight compounds that include acetone, acetaminophen, ethanol, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, furan and molecular oxygen. Mono-oxygenation of these substrates to their reactive metabolites, and the accompanying oxidative stress produced during metabolism, pose health risks because they lead to hepatotoxicity and, often, to liver cancer. Here we describe the AOP for the prolonged\u0026nbsp;activation of Cyp2E1 (MIE) leading to liver cancer (AO). The intervening KEs are oxidative stress (KE1), hepatocytotoxicity (KE2), and sustained/persistent\u0026nbsp;cellular\u0026nbsp;proliferation (KE3). These events occur in the liver, which is the primary site of xenobiotic metabolism in the body. Briefly, the MIE occurs when Cyp2E1 binds a substrate. The Cyp2E1 catalytic cycle is prone to decoupling (adjacent KER1, non-adjacent KER1), which produces oxidative stress (KE1), and mono-oxidation of substrates produces reactive metabolites. Both reactive oxygen species and metabolites cause cytotoxicity (KE2). However, following injury, the liver is able to regenerate itself through an increase in cellular proliferation (KE3). Under conditions of chronic activation of Cyp2E1, excessive chronic increases in levels of reactive oxygen species and cell death, and subsequent dysregulated cellular proliferation, leads to tumour formation (AO). We evaluate the essentiality of the KEs and the biological plausibility of and empirical support for the KERs and report that most are well supported by a large body of scientific literature. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ve focused on data generated in rodent studies using the Cyp2E1 substrates carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethanol and furan.

Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) is a major signaling pathway of intercellular signaling during embryogenesis including the morphogenesis of the face. The SHH pathway is sensitive to chemical induced disruption at multiple points including through disruption to GLI1/2 target gene expression. Activation of the SHH pathway causes a signaling cascade that culminates with the transcription of GLI transcription factors and can occur in an autocrine, paracrine, or juxtracrine manner. When GLI1/2 target gene expression is disrupted during critical windows of development, this signaling cascade is disrupted resulting in reduced outgrowth of the facial prominences and the formation of an OFC. While most of the adjacent events lack studies showing dose or time response for the relationships, there is a high biological plausibility of the proposed AOP. We performed literature searches using Pubmed with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms associated with the key events (KE) of interest. Sources were initially screened for relevance through review of the title and abstract. Those selected were reviewed to determine what if any data existed to support or refute the key event relationship (KER). While this AOP is specific to mouse (mus musculus) during embryonic development, SHH and the development of the face is largely conserved between mouse and human making this AOP able to be extrapolated to risk assessment for human exposures. It is hoped that further studies will be performed to increase the weight of evidence (WoE) for this pathway. This AOP is intended to serve as a tool for risk assessment for drug and chemical exposures during embryonic development when disruption to SHH through a decrease in GLI1/2 target gene expression occurs. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":10937,"created_at":"2022-06-10T09:38:36.000-04:00","updated_at":"2023-11-21T14:32:49.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/491.json"},{"id":392,"title":"Decreased fibrinolysis and activated bradykinin system leading to hyperinflammation","short_name":" Dysregulated fibrinolysis/bradykinin leading to hyperinflammation","abstract":"\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003eThis AOP describes a sequence of molecular, cellular and tissue events associated with immune response, and leading to an uncontrolled, self-perpetuating inflammatory response referred to as hyperinflammation.

While type II deiodinase (DIO2) has thyroxine (T4) as a preferred substrate and is mostly important for converting T4 to the more biologically active triiodothyronine (T3), type I deiodinase is capable of both converting T4 into T3 and converting rT3 to the inactive thyroid hormone 3,3\u0026rsquo; T2.

Swim bladder inflation is known to be under TH control (Brown et al.,1988; Liu and Chan, 2002). Many fish species have a swim bladder which is a gas-filled organ that typically consists of two chambers (Robertson et al., 2007). The posterior chamber inflates during early development in the embryonic phase, while the anterior chamber inflates during late development in the larval phase. Both the posterior and the anterior chamber have an important role in regulating buoyancy, and the anterior chamber has an additional role in hearing (Robertson et al., 2017). This AOP describes how inhibition of DIO1 reduces levels of T3, thereby prohibiting proper inflation of the anterior chamber. Due to its role in regulating buoyancy, this results in reduced swimming performance. Since reduced swimming performance resuls in a decreased ability to forage and avoid predators, this reduces chances of survival. The final adverse outcome is a decrease of the population trajectory. Since many AOPs eventually lead to this more general adverse outcome at the population level, the more specific and informative adverse outcome at the organismal level, increased mortality, is used in the AOP title.

The overall importance of DIO1 versus DIO2 in fish is not exactly clear. DIO1 inhibitors are often also inhibitors of DIO2 (Olker et al., 2019; Stinckens et al. 2018). In the ToxCast DIO1 inhibition single concentration assay, 219 out of 1820 chemicals were positive and 177 of these were also positive for DIO2 inhibition (viewed on 5/7/2022). This complicates the distinction between the relative contribution of DIO1 and DIO2 inhibition to reduced swim bladder inflation. The current state of the art suggests that DIO2 is more important than DIO1 in regulating swim bladder inflation. Six out of seven DIO1 inhibitors impaired posterior chamber inflation, but almost all of these compounds also inhibit DIO2 (Stinckens et al., 2018). Tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA), the only compound that inhibits DIO1 and not DIO2, had no effect on the posterior swim bladder. Exposure to strong DIO2 inhibitors on the other hand affected posterior chamber inflation and/or surface area in all cases.

Many fish species have a swim bladder which is a gas-filled organ that typically consists of two chambers (Robertson et al., 2007). The posterior chamber inflates during early development in the embryonic phase, while the anterior chamber inflates during late development in the larval phase. Both the posterior and the anterior chamber have an important role in regulating buoyancy, and the anterior chamber has an additional role in hearing (Robertson et al., 2017). This AOP describes how inhibition of DIO2 reduces levels of T3, thereby prohibiting proper inflation of the anterior chamber. Due to its role in regulating buoyancy, this results in reduced swimming performance. Since reduced swimming performance results in a decreased ability to forage and avoid predators, this reduces chances of survival. The final adverse outcome is a decrease of the population growth rate. Since many AOPs eventually lead to this more general adverse outcome at the population level, the more specific and informative adverse outcome at the organismal level, increased mortality, is used in the AOP title. Support for this AOP is mainly based on chemical exposures in zebrafish and fathead minnows (Cavallin et al., 2017; Godfrey et al., 2017; Stinckens et al., 2020).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis AOP is part of a larger AOP network describing how decreased synthesis and/or decreased biological activation of THs leads to incomplete or improper inflation of the swim bladder, leading to reduced swimming performance, increased mortality and decreased population trajectory (Knapen et al., 2018; Knapen et al., 2020; Villeneuve et al., 2018). Other than the difference in deiodinase (DIO) isoform, the current AOP is identical to the corresponding AOP leading from DIO1 inhibition to increased mortality via anterior swim bladder inflation (https://aopwiki.org/aops/158). The overall importance of DIO1 versus DIO2 in fish is not exactly clear. DIO2 inhibitors are often also inhibitors of DIO1 (Olker et al., 2019; Stinckens et al. 2018). In the ToxCast DIO2 inhibition single concentration assay, 304 out of 1820 chemicals were positive and 177 of these were also positive for DIO1 inhibition (viewed on 5/7/2022). This complicates the distinction between the relative contribution of DIO1 and DIO2 inhibition to reduced swim bladder inflation. The current state of the art suggests that DIO2 is more important than DIO1 in regulating swim bladder inflation. Six out of seven DIO1 inhibitors impaired posterior chamber inflation, but almost all of these compounds also inhibit DIO2 (Stinckens et al., 2018)). Tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA), the only compound that inhibits DIO1 and not DIO2, had no effect on the posterior swim bladder. Exposure to strong DIO2 inhibitors on the other hand affected posterior chamber inflation and/or surface area in all cases. Therefore the current AOP may be of higher biological relevance compared to AOP 158. Starting from reduced T3 levels, this AOP is identical to the AOP leading from thyroperoxidase inhibition leading to increased mortality via reduced anterior swim bladder inflation (\u003ca href=\"https://aopwiki.org/aops/159\"\u003ehttps://aopwiki.org/aops/159\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":102,"created_at":"2014-01-23T11:09:25.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-06-22T10:29:09.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/156.json"},{"id":155,"title":"Deiodinase 2 inhibition leading to increased mortality via reduced posterior swim bladder inflation","short_name":"DIO2i posterior swim bladder","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis AOP describes the sequence of events leading from deiodinase inhibition to increased mortality via reduced posterior swim bladder inflation. Disruption of the thyroid hormone system is increasingly being recognized as an important toxicity pathway that can cause many adverse outcomes, including developmental abnormalities. Three types of iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO1-3) have been described in vertebrates that activate or inactivate THs and are therefore important mediators of thyroid hormone (TH) action. Type II deiodinase (DIO2) has thyroxine (T4) as a preferred substrate and is mostly important for converting T4 to the more biologically active triiodothyronine (T3). Inhibition of DIO2 therefore reduces T3 levels. As in amphibians, the transition between the different developmental phases in fish, including maturation and inflation of the swim bladder, is mediated by THs (Brown et al., 1988; Liu and Chan, 2002). The swim bladder is a gas-filled organ that typically consists of two chambers (Robertson et al., 2007). The posterior chamber inflates during early development in the embryonic phase, while the anterior chamber inflates during late development in the larval phase.

Numerous environmental factors are known contributors including both chemical (e.g.. asbestos, air pollution and arsenic) and radiation stressors (e.g.. radon\u0026nbsp; gas).\u0026nbsp; Radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer in North America. Evidence suggests that environmental and indoor radon exposure constitutes a significant public health problem. The mechanism of lung cancer development from exposure to radon gas is unclear.

This energy will break DNA double strands (KE1)\u0026nbsp;and initiate\u0026nbsp;double strand break (DSB) repair machinery. \u0026nbsp;In higher eukaryotes, this occurs through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) which is a quick and efficient, but error-prone process (KE2). If DSBs occur in regions of the DNA transcribing critical genes, then mutations (KE3) generated through faulty repair may alter the function of these genes or may cause chromosomal aberrations (KE4), resulting in genomic instability. These events will alter the functions of many gene products and impact cellular pathways such as cell growth, cell cycling, and apoptosis. With these alterations, cell proliferation (KE5) will be promoted by escaping the regulatory control and form hyperplasia in lung epithelial cells, leading eventually to lung cancer (AO) induction and metastasis .

The AOP begins with the\u0026nbsp;deposition of energy (KE#1686) that can lead directly to oxidative stress (KE#1392), defined as an imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants. Oxidation of key functional amino acids can alter signaling proteins, resulting in downstream effects in bone-regulating signaling pathways (KE#2066), specifically the Wnt/\u0026beta;-catenin pathway and the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANK-L) pathway. Concurrently, oxidative damage to vital cellular components, such as the nucleus, mitochondria or cell membrane, can induce oxidative stress-driven cell death (KE#1825), such as apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis. Cell death can reduce osteocyte and osteoblast cell numbers or initiate the secretion of osteoclast-stimulatory molecules that can alter bone cell homeostasis (KE#2089). Impaired activity and differentiation of osteoblasts decreases bone formation, while increased activity and differentiation of osteoclasts increases bone destruction. Subsequent bone remodeling (KE#2090) is then altered, defined by bone resorption being increased above bone formation. Bone density and quality can then be changed, leading to bone loss (KE#2091), the AO. The overall evidence for this AOP is moderate based on the literature to support the pathway.

Elucidating an AOP for embryonic vascular disruption must consider the stepwise events underlying blood vessel patterning. Vascular development commences in the early embryo with in situ formation of nascent vessels from angioblasts, leading to a primary capillary plexus (vasculogenesis). After the onset of blood circulation, the primary vascular pattern is further expanded as new vessels sprout from pre-existing vessels (angiogenesis). Both processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, are regulated by genetic signals and environmental factors dependent on anatomical region, physiological state, and developmental stage of the embryo. The developing vascular network is further shaped into a hierarchical system of arteries and veins, through progressive effects on blood vessel arborization, branching, and pruning (angioadaptation). These latter influences include hemodynamic forces, regional changes in blood flow, local metabolic demands and growth factor signals. Disruptions in embryonic vascular patterning-adaptation may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including birth defects, angiodysplasias and cardiovascular disease, intrauterine growth restriction or prenatal death. Some chemicals may act as potential vascular disrupting compounds (pVDCs) altering the expression, activity or function of molecular signals regulating blood vessel development and remodeling. Critical pathways involve receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., growth factor-signaling), G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., chemokine signaling), and GPI-anchored receptors (e.g. uPAR system).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eDESCRIPTION: This AOP focuses on the regulation and disruption of vasculogenesis-angiogenesis during embryonic development via disruption of the VEGF-signaling pathway. VEGFA binding to its cognate receptor (VEGFR2) triggers angiogenic sprouting, growth and fusion during early development, and in flow-sensing adaptation of vascular development during later development. VEGFR2 inhibition, the postulated molecular initiating event (MIE) for this AOP, may be invoked by effects on VEGFA production, mobility, or receptor binding, and by effects on VEGFR2 cellular expression, molecular function or post-receptor signal transduction pathways. Downstream key events (KE) include altered cell fate and behavior of \u0026#39;endothelial tip cells\u0026#39; (exploratory behavior, cell migration) and endothelial \u0026#39;stalk cells\u0026#39; (cell proliferation, apoptosis). KE relationships (KERs) leading to vascular insufficiency then involve local interactions with other cell types (stromal cells, macrophages), the extracellular matrix (ECM) and micro-physiology (hemodynamics, metabolism). Adverse outcomes (AO) would ultimately vary by anatomical region, organ system, gestational stage and state of the embryo, fetus or placenta when an MIE is invoked.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eRELEVANCE and APPLICATION: Angiogenesis and vascular disruption is a broad concept. The intended use of this AOP in a regulatory context is the predictive toxicology of developmental hazards, especially for integrating data from high-throughput screening (HTS) assays into cell agent-based models for predicting dysmorphogenesis. As part of an integrated assessment of toxicity, this AOP can identify useful information for assessing adverse outcomes relevant to risk assessment and efficient use of resources for validation through predictive models linking developmental toxicity to vascular disruption. AOP-based computer models that simulate vascular development can usher-in new virtual screening techniques to predict what might happen to a developing embryo when exposed to chemicals across different dose-time-stage scenarios, including the range of effects and how cellular injury propagates across development.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":190,"created_at":"2013-07-02T14:37:00.000-04:00","updated_at":"2016-11-29T18:41:13.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/43.json"},{"id":472,"title":"DNA adduct formation leading to kidney failure","short_name":"DNA adduct formation leading to kidney failure","abstract":"\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:11pt\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Calibri\u0026quot;,sans-serif\"\u003eThis Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) depicts a possible sequence of key events that associate how DNA adduct formation caused by platinum anticancer drugs can induce tubular necrosis, resulting in the occurrence of kidney failure as the adverse outcome (AO). Currently, cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are the three most utilised Pt-based drugs used globally for the treatment of cancer. The cytotoxicity of these agents are primarily determined by their DNA adducts. Increased intracellular concentrations following uptake of platinum anticancer agents into the nephron, mostly by proximal convoluted tubules, evoking a cascade of negative cellular responses that can cause tubular necrosis, potentially resulting in kidney failure. The aquation of platinum anticancer agents following cellular uptake produces electrophilic intermediates that covalently bind to nucleophilic sites on DNA to form adducts that represent the molecular initiating event (MIE). The nephrotoxic response following the formation of DNA adducts leads to DNA damage (KE1) and mitochondrial dysfunction (KE2). These events promote the release of reaction oxygen species (ROS) (KE3) to induce oxidative stress (KE4), causing cell death (KE5) and inflammation (KE6). As these cells detach from the basement membrane, they are deposited in the tubular lumen. Tubular obstruction and inflammatory responses to proximal tubule insult can cause secondary toxicity and tubular necrosis (KE7), further amplifying kidney injury and a progressive decline of function, finally resulting in kidney failure (AO). This information is primarily based on mechanisms of actions previously described in cited literature sources and intended as a resource template for AOP development and data organization. The primary species of this AOP is humans, most often observed following chemotherapeutic intervention when treating a range of tumours and multiple malignancies; supported by data with potential applicability for other species. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":14229,"created_at":"2022-10-18T07:19:05.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-10-19T14:15:01.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/472.json"},{"id":240,"title":"DNA Adducts Leading to Liver Hemangiosarcoma","short_name":"DNA Adduct-mediated Liver Hemangiosarcoma","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":157,"created_at":"2016-01-27T15:40:24.000-05:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T09:41:23.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/240.json"},{"id":336,"title":"DNA methyltransferase inhibition leading to population decline (1)","short_name":"DNMT inhibtion leading to population decline (1)","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":322,"created_at":"2016-06-30T07:13:47.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-01-17T05:17:22.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/336.json"},{"id":337,"title":"DNA methyltransferase inhibition leading to population decline (2)","short_name":" DNMT inhibtion leading to population decline (2)","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":322,"created_at":"2016-06-30T07:13:47.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-01-17T05:17:22.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/337.json"},{"id":338,"title":"DNA methyltransferase inhibition leading to population decline (3)","short_name":"DNMT inhibtion leading to population decline (3)","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":322,"created_at":"2016-06-30T07:13:47.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-01-17T05:17:22.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/338.json"},{"id":339,"title":"DNA methyltransferase inhibition leading to population decline (4)","short_name":" DNMT inhibtion leading to population decline (4)","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":322,"created_at":"2016-06-30T07:13:47.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-01-17T05:17:22.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/339.json"},{"id":340,"title":"DNA methyltransferase inhibition leading to transgenerational effects (1)","short_name":" DNMT inhibtion leading to transgenerational effects (1)","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":322,"created_at":"2016-06-30T07:13:47.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-01-17T05:17:22.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/340.json"},{"id":341,"title":"DNA methyltransferase inhibition leading to transgenerational effects (2)","short_name":"  DNMT inhibtion leading to transgenerational effects (2)","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":322,"created_at":"2016-06-30T07:13:47.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-01-17T05:17:22.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/341.json"},{"id":466,"title":"Doda decarboxylase leading to mortality","short_name":"Doda decarboxylase leading to mortality","abstract":"\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:11pt\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Times New Roman\u0026quot;,serif\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Arial\u0026quot;,sans-serif\"\u003eWe propose this AOP associated with the molting process based on the literatures.

In insects, different from mammals, melanin is synthesized mainly from dopamine, which is produced from 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase (Ddc). Silencing of Ddc has been shown to cause incomplete and premature molting or failed pupation. This process affects pigmentation and cuticle sclerosis, resulting in an incomplete moulting process.

The molecular initiating event (MIE) is gestational estrogen receptor (ER) activation; particularly, stromal activation at in utero time of exposure. The ER is a master transcriptional regulator, with proliferation as its primary effect, and is the main mediator of breast development [24, 25]. Human-relevant EDC exposure triggers transcriptional activity that promotes altered signaling between the epithelial and stromal tissue compartments leading to disrupted tensional homeostasis [26] and tissue architecture. Inflammation and altered cellular differentiation are major cell- and tissue-level key events (KEs) mediating these disruptions. The pathway converges on the following mammary gland adverse outcomes (AOs) at the tissue- and organ-levels: altered density, structure and hormone sensitivity along with hyperplasia. Epigenetic alterations are a cellular-level AO that propagate gestational EDC exposure to later-life risk through cellular memory that directs ER-mediated gene expression and altered mammary development. Risk of tumorigenesis follows from these AOs.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe industrial estrogen, bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most data-rich chemicals related to breast cancer and altered mammary gland development [11]. As such, studies in model rodent strains following gestational EDC exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) or DES provide experimental support for this AOP and human-relevance. A thorough search of the literature yielded experimental evidence for this AOP as directed by a mix of natural and MeSH term search logic specifying rodents and non-human primates (population); human-relevant, in utero exposure to BPA or DES (exposure); and mammary gland AOs (outcome) [27-32] (see PECO statement, Table 1 below). Most studies investigating EDC-effects on mammary development heavily describe altered growth and structure, resulting in limited mechanistic understanding. This AOP integrates knowledge and tools from investigations of established breast cancer risk factors such as density and obesity to enhance understanding of the molecular- and cellular-driven etiologies of altered mammary structure and growth. Integrating this knowledge promotes the development of in vitro assays capable of predicting high-risk phenotypes and offers efficient alternatives to in vivo mammary gland evaluation. Ultimately, making these links in the knowledge base will improve screening to identify chemicals that act on gestational development and will more specifically target chemical contributions to later-life breast cancer risk in toxicity testing. Productive intermediate testing endpoints would follow ER-binding, -activation and steroidogenesis (OECD TG-455; EDSP TG-890[33, 34]), precede carcinogenicity (OECD TG-451, and -453) and connect these with EDC-effects on breast cancer due to prenatal exposure (OECD TG-414, -415, -416, -422, -443). This AOP will also describe \u0026lsquo;missed opportunities\u0026rsquo; in the existing evidence; not reporting or measuring traditional toxicity testing endpoints, like uterine weight and body weight alongside more sensitive mammary gland growth and structural changes. Failure to do this in parallel within the same study undermines the sensitivity of these endpoints to predict later-life breast cancer risk.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTable 1.\u0026nbsp;PECO statement [27, 28].\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e A statement of the Population, Exposure, Comparators and Outcomes was prepared to direct objective experimental study collection for this AOP synthesis on breast cancer risk from early-life EDC exposure.

During a molt cycle, the animals generate new exoskeletons by the epidermis and shed the old ones in order to grow. Successful molting is key to survival, development and reproduction. Over half a century research on arthropod endocrinology reveals that molting is precisely controlled by complex multi-hormone systems, with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) being the key effective hormone to mediate different biological processes that are necessary for molting. The hormonal actions of 20E are exerted through binding and modulation of the ecdysone receptors (EcR), which are nuclear transcriptional factors that regulate a wide range of physiological and behavioral changes. Based on this knowledge, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) targeting at the EcRs are developed as pesticides and anti-parasite pharmaceuticals in order to disrupt the molting cycles of \u0026ldquo;harmful\u0026rdquo; arthropods and protect the agriculture and aquaculture. However, environmental residues of these EDCs may also affect non-target species, such as a number of crustaceans (e.g. crabs and lobsters) with great ecological and economical values, due to highly conserved endocrine systems in arthropods. Substantial efforts are therefore needed to assess the environmental hazards and risks of EDCs on non-target species. Due to the high number (over a million described) of species in the phylum of \u003cem\u003eArthopoda\u003c/em\u003e, it is not feasible to perform toxicity testing for each species as well as EDC. Construction of universal models on basis of systems (eco)toxicology and phylogenetic similarities for understanding the environmental endocrine disruption (ED) effects may serve as a potential solution. The current AOP is therefore developed based on available information in the databases to identify knowledge gaps in this research field. The conceptual AOP will be further expanded using a combination of laboratory studies and advance \u003cem\u003ein sillico\u003c/em\u003e predictions of potential EcR ligands and taxonomic appllicablity to inform environmental risk assessment as an ultimate goal.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":184,"created_at":"2013-08-12T09:37:11.000-04:00","updated_at":"2023-12-04T04:48:31.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/4.json"},{"id":148,"title":"EGFR Activation Leading to Decreased Lung Function","short_name":"Decreased lung function","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eIncrease in mucin production and consequent mucus hypersecretion in the airways are key attributes of many lung diseases, including asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitis, all of which are characterized by decreased lung function (Yoshida and Tuder, 2007). Mucus hypersecretion is characterized by an increase in the number of goblet cells, mucin synthesis and mucus secretion which can result in airway obstruction and lung function decline (Kim and Criner, 2015, Yoshida and Tuder, 2007). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated signaling has been identified as the key pathway that leads to airway mucin production (Burgel and Nadel, 2008). This AOP for decreased lung function originates in EGFR activation in the airway epithelium. It describes the subsequent key events on the cellular and organ level that need to take place to culminate in the adverse outcome. The causal relationships in this AOP, including EGFR activation leading to increased number of mucin-producing goblet cells and to increased mucin production, are substantiated by multiple lines of evidence in studies performed using different model systems and approaches. Understanding how the inhaled toxicant-induced EGFR activation leads to pulmonary function impairment will be relevant to risk assessment of airborne pollutant exposure and how they contribute to the development and progression of the disease.

Liver fibrosis, in particular, is a health problem resulting from chronic or repeated-dose chemical exposure and it is considered as an adverse outcome of regulatory interest. Liver fibrosis is a long and complex process involving various hepatic cell types, molecular mediators, receptors and signaling pathways. It occurs as a result of the imbalance between collagen deposition and destruction but also changes in the extracellular matrix composition (ECM). Due to this complexity appropriate cell model is currently unavailable.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe current AOP links endocytic lysosomal uptake and the formation of liver fibrosis. The molecular initiating event (MIE) is endocytic lysosomal uptake of chemicals, leading to lysosomal disruption, the first key event (KE). Lysosomal disruption induces mitochondrial dysfunction, which leads to cell injury and both apoptosis and necrosis. Lysosomal disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell injury/death present KEs on the cellular level. Cell death releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which leads to increased production\u0026nbsp;of pro-inflammatory mediators, the next KE along the path. Inflammatory mediators attract and activate leukocytes, which present the next KE. Activated leukocytes through molecular mediators activate hepatic stellate cells, which increases \u0026alpha;-SMA in them. This KE increases the amount of collagen I and III, which causes its accumulation. Collagen accumulation presents KE at the tissue level and leads to adverse outcome (AO) - liver fibrosis, which changes the normal functioning of the whole organ. There is also an important on-going process present throughout the pathway, which is connected with different KEs- oxidative stress.

The majority (approximately 75 percent) of breast cancer cases express the estrogen receptor. Both animal and human studies strongly support that activation of the estrogen receptor stimulates breast cancer development and progression. We created the ER-mediated breast cancer AOP to frame how ER activation (the MIE) leads to breast cancer (the AO).

For example, endothelial cells express ER and upon ER activation, undergo gene expression and protein production changes. Consequently, endothelial cell proliferation and migration is increased, leading to increased angiogenesis, which supports the proliferation of breast cancer epithelial cells. While estrogens do not target fibroblasts, adipocytes, or macrophages directly, they become activated as breast cancer progresses. It is not well understood if there is a direct relationship between estrogen signaling and stromal cell activation, however, activated cells stimulate cancer cell proliferation, influence chemical response, increase cell motility, and rearrange the extracellular matrix. Moreover, adipocytes contribute to the AOP through metabolism of testosterone to estrogen, and fibroblasts have been shown to regulate estrogen receptor regulated genes in epithelial cells.

Birds are also known to be vulnerable to ER agonists causing disruption of estrogen-regulated functions such as sexual differentiation and sexual behaviour. Model species such as the Japanese quail have been widely used as a model for studying various long-term effects after embryonic exposure to ER agonists. In terms of teleost fish, exposure to ER agonists leads to a suite of adverse outcomes depending upon whether exposures occur during or beyond the larval, juvenile and adult life-stages. For example, aquatic exposure to potent ER agonists during the larval and juvenile life-stages may leads to gonadal and renal pathology and skewed-sex ratios in adult fish (potentially 100% females).

Basic toxicity studies on these metabolites give clues to the critical events involved in its mode of action resulting in hepatacarcinogenesis. These metabolites were given at doses to mimic systemic exposure that would result following a tumorigenic dose of Thiamethoxam. When administered directly in the rodent bioassay (rats and mice), the CGA 322704 and CGA 265307 metabolites did not result in any tumors or any other effect in the liver including altered serum cholesterol, liver toxicity, apoptosis, or increased cell proliferation.

Direct exposure to metabolite CGA 330050 did not result in tumors but did result in the same liver toxicity effects as for thiamethoxam.

Decreased population trajectory resulting from reduced pigmentation patterns in the fish body is a potential endpoint for eco-toxicity. The proposed endpoint will provide useful high throughput risk assessment screening tools for potential chemicals. Consequently, this AOP can be applied to the prediction of eco-toxicity caused by the inhibition of TYR.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cdiv\u003e\r\n\u003cdiv\u003e\r\n\u003cdiv\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":859,"created_at":"2019-04-12T16:01:11.000-04:00","updated_at":"2024-01-26T12:57:46.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/292.json"},{"id":489,"title":"Inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels leading to decreased cognition","short_name":"Voltage-gated sodium channels and DNT","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":9061,"created_at":"2022-02-16T08:01:58.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-02-21T08:39:30.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/489.json"},{"id":451,"title":"Interaction with lung resident cell membrane components leads to lung cancer","short_name":"Interaction with lung cells leads to lung cancer","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis AOP was developed and first presented in\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/ftox.2021.653386\"\u003eNymark et al. 2021\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe particulate fraction of diesel exhaust is known to be required for carcinogenesis, since filtered exhaust does not cause lung cancer in rodents (Brightwell et al., 1989). Inhaled, nanosized particles deposit primarily in the alveolar region, where clearance is low, and lead to prolonged particle retention enabling particle-bio interaction (Oberd\u0026ouml;rster et al., 2005;\u0026nbsp;Gat\u0026eacute; et al., 2017). Interaction between particles and lung resident cell membrane components (Figure 1A below in the Background section, MIE) leads to inflammation (KE1A) which is proportional to the total deposited surface area (Schmid and Stoeger, 2016;\u0026nbsp;Danielsen et al., 2020;\u0026nbsp;Kokot et al., 2020). The persistence of particles results in long-lasting inflammation (Hougaard et al., 2010;\u0026nbsp;Ch\u0026eacute;zeau et al., 2018). Metabolic activity of pro-inflammatory cells induces formation of ROS, which may also be augmented by the surface reactivity of particles themselves (Jacobsen et al., 2008b;\u0026nbsp;Bendtsen et al., 2020). The sustained inflammatory signaling and concomitant synthesis of reactive radicals, cause a chronic state of oxidant-antioxidant imbalance and loss of protective mechanisms, potentially resulting in secondary genotoxicity (KE1B) (Evans et al., 2019a). Diesel exhaust consists of nanosized particles of inorganic and organic carbon with associated metal oxides and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Taxell and Santonen, 2016;\u0026nbsp;Bendtsen et al., 2020). Both the carbon core and solvent-extractable fractions containing PAHs are mutagenic\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003ein vivo\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;and several metal (oxides) have been classified as (possibly) carcinogenic (IARC, 2006,\u0026nbsp;2012b;\u0026nbsp;Hashimoto et al., 2007). It is possible that such genotoxic agents leach from the pulmonary deposited particles leading to activation of alternative AOPs associated with the formation of bulky DNA adducts and resulting in accumulation of mutations (Li and Nel, 2006) as indicated by the alternative path in\u0026nbsp;Figure 1A below in the Background section\u0026nbsp;(in gray) (Sasaki et al., 2020). In addition, the insoluble carbon core generates particle-induced ROS leading to oxidative stress (KE1C) (Bendtsen et al., 2020;\u0026nbsp;Gren et al., 2020). In a recent study of five diesel exhaust particles designed to differ in chemical composition, DNA strand breaks (KE2) in bronchoalveolar lavage cells were found to correlate with the ROS forming capacity of the particles (Bendtsen et al., 2020). Similarly, carbon black generates surface-dependent ROS, causing oxidative DNA damage (KE2) and mutagenicity (KE3)\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003ein vivo\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003ein vitro\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;(Jacobsen et al., 2008b).

Initial development of this AOP is based largely on IYD literature of clinical evidence in humans, rat model experiments, and biochemical and genetic analyses. The enzyme IYD catalyzes the recycling of iodide from the byproducts of thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis [monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT)] within the thyroid gland as well as other organs, including liver and kidney. IYD protects against excretion of critical iodide and promotes accumulation of iodide in thyroid follicular cells for TH synthesis, which is especially critical for low iodine diets and low iodine environments (including most freshwater ecosystems). Therefore, failure or chemical inhibition of IYD could reduce TH synthesis, resulting in TH insufficiency in tissues and subsequent altered development. Failure of this enzyme in humans, due to mutations in the IYD gene (DEHAL1), has been shown to have negative developmental consequences, including hypothyroidism, goiter, and mental retardation. In rat exposures with suspected IYD inhibitors, serum T4 and T3 were reduced, thyroid gland size and TSH increased, and weight gain was reduced. Additionally, IYD has been shown to be a potential chemical target for thyroid axis disruption through in vitro inhibition assays with polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, agrichemicals, antiparasitics, pharmaceuticals, and food colorants.

Daphniids normally go through parthenogenic reproduction cycles in which only female offspring are produced. When under environmental stress (e.g. chemical exposure, short length of daylight, food shortage and high population density), a switch of reproductive strategy from asexual to sexual reproduction occurs and male offspring are produced. As an indicator of ED, the induction of male offspring is used as an important endpoint in daphnia toxicity tests. It has been widely recognized that analogs of the crustacean juvenile hormone (JH), methyl farnesoate (MF) are able to bind and activate the crustacean JH receptor, methoprene tolerant (Met), thus inducing the putative sex determination genes, doublesex genes, and causing male offspring formation. The induction of male neonates is usually associated with reduced fecundity and population decline as adverse ED effects.

In the heart, calcium dynamics and signaling are essential for cardiac muscle contraction, thus the perturbation of these processes may impair organ function and health. Different types of calcium channels contribute to the timely regulation of calcium currents at the cellular level. Among them, the L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) are responsible for the excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle. The pharmacological modulation of this target is an important tool for the treatment of cardiac pathologies, and several drugs that block LTCCs have been developed in the last few decades.

This AOP should be considered part of a network, together with AOP 262. The AOP development was based on over 1,100 in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data points extracted from approximately 150 publications that investigated a) the effects of calcium channel blockers on different components of the cardiovascular system, and b) the effects of genetic manipulations of the drug target. For each Key Event (KE), a quantitative analysis was performed to determine effect direction and degree of responsiveness. A database-specific confidence index was assigned to each KE according to the degree of reproducibility of the effect. Many KEs of this AOP can be experimentally quantified using different specific endpoints. Therefore, the responsiveness analysis of each endpoint was performed to quantify the sensitivity of each measurement to the blockade of LTCCs. This knowledge has both biological and methodological significance. In the latter case, it can effectively inform the development of suitable testing strategies aimed at maximizing the probability to detect changes in a given KE.

This adverse outcome pathway (AOP) describes the connections between the inhibition of lung surfactant function, and how this is connected to decreased\u0026nbsp;lung function. Lung surfactant is a thin layer of lipids and proteins that lines the respiratory parts of the lungs. Decreased lung function in humans is characterized by symptoms such as coughing, difficult breathing, tightness in the chest, fever and vomiting (AO) [1, 2]. In experimental animals acute inhalation toxicity is defined as the total of adverse effects caused by a substance following a single uninterrupted exposure by inhalation over a short period of time (24 hours or less) to a substance capable of being inhaled [3]. This AOP describes one of the pathways that can lead to decreased\u0026nbsp;lung function seen as respiratory clinical signs of toxicity in humans and experimental animals. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:11pt\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Calibri\u0026quot;,sans-serif\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Times New Roman\u0026quot;,serif\"\u003eThe main function of lung surfactant is to lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface during the breathing cycle. Inhaling substances that reach the alveoli can potentially interact with and inhibit the lung surfactant function (MIE). Inhibition leads to an increase in minimum surface tension and alveolar collapse (KE1), the individual alveoli can stay closed or be open again by the force of the inhaled air. If the alveolus stays closed, this reduces the tidal volume (KE3), reducing the area for gas exchange in the lungs and reduces blood oxygenation (hypoxemia). If the alveolus reopens, this can lead to loss of capillary membrane integrity due to shear stress on the epithelium (KE2) and bleeding into the lungs. Blood components (such as albumin and fibrin) reaching the air-liquid interface will further disrupt lung surfactant function by interacting with the lung surfactant (feedback loop between KE2 and MIE) [4-7] leading to the exacerbation of the process. The combination of alveolar collapse, loss of capillary membrane integrity and reduced tidal volume leads to decreased\u0026nbsp;lung function. The MIE (lung surfactant function inhibition) can be examined \u003cem\u003ein vitro\u003c/em\u003e by measuring the effect of a substance or mixture of substances on the lung surfactant function. The effects of blood entering the lung and interacting with lung surfactant can likewise be studied in the \u003cem\u003ein vitro \u003c/em\u003eassay. Reduced tidal volume can be measured \u003cem\u003ein vivo\u003c/em\u003e, using experimental animals in whole body plethysmographs that are exposed to the substance in question, while monitoring respiration parameters. The effect of reduced tidal volume, hypoxemia, can be measured by analysing the oxygenation of the blood both from experimental animals, and patients that have inhaled substances leading to immediate adverse lung effects. The loss of capillary membrane integrity can be examined in experimental animals, by analysing liquid flushed from the lungs (broncho-alveolar lavage), and in lavage from patients undergoing examination during acute lung injury [8].\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:11pt\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Calibri\u0026quot;,sans-serif\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:\u0026quot;Times New Roman\u0026quot;,serif\"\u003eDecreased lung function is observed frequently in humans [2].

The importance of steatosis is highlighted from the fact that it is a prerequisite for the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a clinicopathological condition that comprises a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from steatosis alone to steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents only a stage in the spectrum of NAFLD and is defined pathologically by the presence of steatosis together with necro-inflammatory activity. The clinical implications of NAFLD are derived mostly from its potential to progress to end-stage liver disease, whereas simple uncomplicated steatosis follows a relatively benign course in most patients. Steatosis is the output of the disturbance on the homeostasis of hepatic lipids which depends on the dynamic balance of several pathways including fatty acid (FA) uptake, de novo FA synthesis, \u0026beta;-oxidation, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. It is characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets (mainly triglycerides) in the hepatocytes. This AOP describes the linkage between hepatic steatosis triggered by nuclear receptors activation (PPAR gamma and LXR) through modulation of genes responsible for lipid homeostasis [the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), the sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), the free fatty acid uptake transporter FAT/CD36, the fatty acid synthase (FAS), the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)] which subsequently leasds to in rease of de novo fatty acids/triglycerides synthesis and fat influx from the peripheral tissues to liver. The accumulation of lipid in the hepatocytes can cause cytoplasm displacement, nucleus distortion, mitochondrial toxicity and eventually necrosis and/or apoptosis. The progression of this condition can lead to tissue inflammation (steatohepatitis) and fibrosis with the involvement of other cells of the hepatic tissue like the Kupffer (inflammation) and the stellate (fibrosis) cells.

OP-induced cognitive deficits were observe not only among farm worker but also among environmentally exposed individual\u0026nbsp;(Corral SA et al., 2017). The present adverse outcome\u0026nbsp;pathways (AOP) describes the risk associated with a molecular initiating event (MIE) characteristic of OP exposure in which inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity causes a series of key events (KEs) that ultimately manifest as the adverse outcome (AO) of cognitive defects. The MIE of inhibited AChE triggers the KEs: accumulation of synaptic AChE (KE 1), increase of cholinergic signaling (KE 2), decrease of neuronal network function (KE 3), and\u0026nbsp;decrease of cognitive function as an adverse outcome. The content of this AOP draws upon content from other AOPs in the AOPwiki page and has expanded interpretation in the interconnected network of AOPs linking the MIE of AChE inhibition to other AOs, including acute mortality.\u0026nbsp; The common threads between this and the other AOPs include common KEs of acetylcholine (ACh) accumulation at the synapses (KE 1), which results in (KE 2) excessive signaling from cholinergic neurons on a broad range of tissues throughout the body. \u0026nbsp;The MIE is engaged when OP binds to AChE causing an irreversible phosphorylation status of the enzyme. AChE is an enzyme responsible for controlling the level of the excitatory neurotransmitter, ACh, at neural synapses and neuromuscular junctions. AChE negatively regulates ACh via hydrolysis to acetic acid and choline (Wilson 2010). Inhibition of AChE (MIE) prevents degradation of ACh, which leads to (KE1) ACh accumulation at neural synapses and neuromuscular junctions in the central and peripheral nervous systems.

ACh availability is decreased when this neurotransmitter is degraded by AChE and by negative feedback loops controlled by muscarinic M2 receptors on the presynaptic neuron within the synapse (Soreq and Seidman, 2001).\u0026nbsp;Affinity of ACh for metabotropic muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) and ionotropic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), as well as rates of synaptic clearance (mediated through AChE activity) and local concentration of ACh in and outside the synapse, is critical for the control and specificity of cholinergic signaling (KE 2) (Sarter M\u0026nbsp;et al., 2009,\u0026nbsp;Picciotto MR, et al., 2012).\u0026nbsp;Excessive accumulation of ACh at neural synapses (KE 1) and at neural-muscular junctions results in increased cholinergic signaling (KE 2) (AOP 16, https://aopwiki.org/aops/16).\u0026nbsp;Endogenously released ACh regulates cognitive functions (AO), by acting as a neuromodulator and/or acting as a direct transmitter via nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in CNS by cholinergic signaling\u0026nbsp;(KE 2) (Luchicchi A et al., 2014), which is evidence of direct relationship between KE2 and AO. The ability of a neuron to communicate is based on neural network formation (KE 3) that relies on functional synapse establishment by cholinergic neurons (KE 2) (Col\u0026oacute;n-Ramos, 2009) this is evidence that KE 2 leads to KE3. Muscarinic cholinergic activity influences sensory processing by facilitating or depressing neuronal responses to specific stimuli, and by modulating connection strength and neural synchronization: this results in the fine-tuning of cellular and network properties of neurons during developmental processes, the execution of attention tasks and perceptual learning (Colangelo C\u0026nbsp;et al., 2019, Groleau et al., 2015). Damage or destruction of neurons during development when they are in the process of synapse formation, integration, and formation of neural networks, disrupts the organization and function of these networks (KE3), thereby setting the stage for subsequent impairment of learning and memory as sign of cognitive defects (AO), thus evident that KE 3 leads to AO. (AOP 13, https://aopwiki.org/aops/13). \u0026nbsp;Therefore, if exposure to OP occurs during neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis processes, there is potential to initiate KE3, functional neuronal network damage, leading to the cognitive defects AO.\u0026nbsp;Thus, this AOP provides a needed link to between chronic AChE inhibition and detrimental long-term impacts on cognitive function, which is relevant for understanding the impacts of long-term environmental and occupational OP pesticide exposures.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":1529,"created_at":"2020-05-02T15:51:11.000-04:00","updated_at":"2023-08-03T13:00:22.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/405.json"},{"id":413,"title":"Oxidation and antagonism of reduced glutathione leading to mortality via acute renal failure","short_name":"Oxidation of Reduced Glutathione Leading to Mortality","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eWe are assiduously exploring mechanisms of toxicity of uranium to fish species in the context of uranium mining via an adverse outcome pathway (AOP).

Reduced glutathione is an antioxidant that helps cellular redox homeostasis. This oxidation prevents anti-oxidant function. The following key event - increase in ROS, is a result of both uranium promoting ROS and oxidizing glutathione, to perpetrate oxidative stress. An increase in ROS leaves major macromolecules such as DNA, proteins and membrane phospholipids susceptible to damage. Although there are multiple effects as a result of an increase in ROS, an AOP calls for one specific path. Thus, our following key event is lipid peroxidation, as it is widely observed in uranium-fish toxicity studies. Consequently, the increase in ROS is being investigated for its ability to damage lipids in the cell membranes, more specifically in the kidney for this AOP.

Damage then occurs to red blood cells (RBCs) and methemoglobinemia ensues which is characterized by reduced RBCs, hemoglobin concentration, and Heinz body formation (Ellis et al. 1985, Lee et al. 1976, 1978, Hazleton Laboratories 1977, 1982, Kozuka et al. 1978, 1979, Bolt et al. 2006). The adverse outcome due to such hematological effects is cyanosis with possible death if methemoglobin levels become severe. Hemoglobin adducts are also formed by these chemicals (Sabbioni et al. 2006). Sinusoidal congestion was noted in animals who were exposed to 2,4-DNT or 2,6-DNT (Deng et al. 2011) while hemosiderosis was reported in another study involving DNT (Lee et al. 1978) and in aniline studies. A compensatory response to possible anemic effects has been observed in animals including increased peripheral reticulocytes (Deng et al. 2011) and induction of genes associated with heme biosynthesis (CPOX and UROS) (Rawat et al. 2010). Oxidative stress is also induced upon this interaction with the RBC which may lead to DNA damage and cell death to not only the RBC but other cells such as hepatocytes (Deng et al. 2011). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6pd) was found to be significantly down-regulated in animals treated with 2,4-DNT for 14 d which leads to decreased levels of NADPH, a coenzyme used to properly maintain glutathione levels and therefore protect cells, especially RBC, from oxidative damage (Wilbanks, et al., unpublished observations). In response to increased oxidative stress, protective mechanisms such as the Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress response may be induced (Deng et al. 2011). While this AOP specifically shows effects of 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT, the principal adverse pathways of oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) leading to methemoglobinemia and its downsteam effects and oxidative stress formation leading to its downstream effects are shared with the more well characterized structurally similar compound group of N-hydroxyl anilines.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":234,"created_at":"2013-05-02T11:27:51.000-04:00","updated_at":"2016-11-29T18:41:13.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/31.json"},{"id":296,"title":"Oxidative DNA damage leading to chromosomal aberrations and mutations","short_name":"Oxidative DNA damage, chromosomal aberrations and mutations","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis AOP\u0026nbsp;network describes the linkage between oxidative DNA damage and irreversible genomic damage (chromosomal aberrations and mutations).

The development of this AOP relies on evidence collected from rodent models and incorporates human mechanistic and epidemiological data. The PPAR\u0026alpha; is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor family, which also includes the steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. The hypothesis that PPAR\u0026alpha; action is the mechanistic basis for effects on the reproductive system arises from limited experimental data indicating relationships between activation of this receptor and impairment of steroidogenesis leading to reproductive toxicity. PPARs play important roles in the metabolic regulation of lipids, of which cholesterol, in particular, being a precursor of steroid hormones, makes the link between lipid metabolism to effects on reproduction. The key events in the pathway comprise the activation of PPAR\u0026alpha;, followed by the disruption cholesterol transport in mitochondria, impairment of hormonal balance which leads to malformation of the reproductive tract in males which may lead to impaired fertility. The PPAR\u0026alpha;-initiated AOP to rodent male developmental toxicity is a first step for structuring current knowledge about a mode of action which is neither AR-mediated nor via direct steroidogenesis enzymes inhibition.

Liver fibrosis in particular is an important human health issue associated with chemical exposure and predictive assays are lacking; it is a typical result of chronic or repeated-dose toxic injury and one of the considered endpoints for regulatory purposes. It is a long-term process in which inflammation, tissue destruction, and repair occur simultaneously, together with sustained production of growth factors and fibrogenic cytokines due to a complex interplay between various hepatic cell types, various receptors and signalling pathways which lead to an imbalance between the deposition and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a change of ECM composition. Due to this complex situation an adequate cell model is not available and an \u003cem\u003ein vitro\u003c/em\u003e evaluation of fibrogenic potential is therefore not feasible. A sufficiently detailed description of the AOP to liver fibrosis might support chemical risk assessment by indicating early (upstream) markers for downstream events and facilitate a testing strategy without the need for a sophisticated cell model. This systematic and coherent display of currently available mechanistic-toxicological information can serve as a knowledge-based repository for identification/selection/development of \u003cem\u003ein vitro\u003c/em\u003e methods suitable for measuring key events (KEs) and their relationships along the AOP and to facilitate the use of alternative data for regulatory purposes. Identified uncertainties and knowledge gaps can direct future research by priority setting and targeted testing. The KE descriptions can be used for hazard identification and read-across to assess the toxic potential of an untested substance.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis AOP describes the linkage between hepatic injury caused by protein alkylation and the formation of liver fibrosis. The molecular initiating event (MIE) is protein alkylation, leading to structural and functional cell injury and further to cell death, the first KE. Apoptotic hepatocytes undergo genomic DNA fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Upon engulfment of apoptotic bodies Kupffer cells (KCs) are activated, the next KE along the pathway. Activated KCs are the main source of TGF-\u0026beta;1, the most potent profibrogenic cytokine. TGF-\u0026beta;1 expression therefore is considered a KE that causes the next KE, hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) activation, meaning the transdifferentiation from a quiescent vitamin A\u0026ndash;storing cell to a proliferative and contractile myofibroblast, the central effector in hepatic fibrosis. Activated HSCs cause progressive collagen accumulation, which together with changes in ECM composition signifies the KE on tissue level. The excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins progressively affects the whole organ and alters its normal functioning, which corresponds to liver fibrosis, the adverse outcome (AO).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two further events that play an important role in driving fibrogenesis, namely oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Both are on-going processes being present throughout the pathway and interconnected with most of the KEs. Hence, they are not classified as KEs themselves and described in the individual KE and key event relationship (KER) descriptions. The inflammatory response plays an important role in driving fibrogenesis, since persistent inflammation precedes fibrosis. Inflammatory signalling stems from injured hepatocytes, activated KCs and HSCs. Inflammatory and fibrogenic cells stimulate each other in amplifying fibrosis. Chemokines and their receptors provoke further fibrogenesis, as well as interacting with inflammatory cells to modify the immune response during injury. Oxidative stress, as well, plays a crucial role in liver fibrogenesis by inducing hepatocyte apoptosis, activation of KCs and HSCs and fuelling inflammation. ROS contributing to oxidative stress are generated by hepatocytes, KCs, HSCs and inflammatory cells.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis purely qualitative AOP description is plausible, the scientific data supporting the AOP are logic, coherent and consistent and there is temporal agreement between the individual KEs.

An AOP based on the mode of action (MOA) of rodent liver tumor promotion by dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) has been developed and the weight of evidence (WoE) of key event relationships (KERs) evaluated using evolved Bradford Hill considerations. Dioxins and DLCs are potent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands that cause a range of species-specific adverse outcomes. The occurrence of KEs is necessary for inducing downstream biological responses and KEs may occur at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organ levels. The common convention is that an AOP begins with the toxicant interaction with a biological response element; for this AOP, this initial event is binding of a DLC ligand to the AHR. Data from mechanistic studies, lifetime bioassays and approximately thirty initiation-promotion studies have established a number of substances, including dioxin-like chemicals and indole-3-carbinol from brassica vegetables, as rat liver tumor promoters. Such studies clearly show that sustained AHR activation, weeks or months in duration, is necessary to induce rodent liver tumor promotion; hence, sustained AHR activation is deemed the molecular initiating event (MIE). After this MIE, subsequent KEs are 1) changes in cellular growth homeostasis likely associated with expression changes in a number of genes and observed as development of hepatic foci and decreases in apoptosis within foci; 2) extensive liver toxicity observed as the constellation of effects called toxic hepatopathy; 3) cellular proliferation and hyperplasia in several hepatic cell types. This progression of KEs culminates in the AO, the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas and cholangiolar carcinomas. A rich data set provides both qualitative and quantitative knowledge of the progression of this AOP through KEs and the KERs. Thus, the WoE for this AOP is judged to be strong. Species-specific effects of dioxins and DLCs are well known -- humans are less responsive than rodents and rodent species differ in sensitivity between strains. Consequently, application of this AOP to evaluate potential human health risks must take these differences into account.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003ePlease also see Becker, R.A., Patlewicz, G., Simon, T.W., Rowlands, J.C., Budinsky, R.A. 2015.

Previous peer-reviewed work has shown that pregnant and lactating rats exposed to a thyroid peroxidase (TPO) inhibitor have reduced serum thyroid hormone concentrations, and their offspring later exhibit a permanent periventricular heterotopia. Additionally, functional studies have shown these affected offspring display an increased seizure incidence, and epilepsy is closely correlated to heterotopia in patients.

Chemical or other stressor antagnoism of TR, the molecular-initiating event (MIE), results in abnormal gene transcription.\u0026nbsp; TR mediated genes are essential for normal mammalian brain development, both prenatally and postnatally, and abnormal modulation of the these genes during critical developmental windows for brain development can resutl in atypical\u0026nbsp; neuroanatomical and neurophysiocal development, with subsequent adverse effects on teh developmetn of cognitive functions.\u0026nbsp; Therefore, chemicals or other stressors that interfere with TR mediated genes have the potential to cause\u0026nbsp; result in adverse neurodevelopmental effects in offspring. Herein, we discuss the implications of developmental TR antagonism for hippocampal anatomy, function, and ultimately neural function controlled by the hippocampus. The biochemistry of normal\u0026nbsp; TR function is well known across species. The hippocampus is known to be critically involved in cognitive, emotional, and memory function. The adverse consequences of TR antagnoism depends the severity, developmental timing, and impacts on different TR isoforms, indicating that exposure to TR antagonoists may produce different effects at different developmental windows of exposure.

The enzyme thyroperoxidase (TPO) is essential for the synthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid follicles. Inhibition of TPO reduces thyroid hormone (TH) levels. Thyroid hormones are critical in regulating developmental processes and thyroid hormone disruption can interfere with normal development. Swim bladder inflation is known to be under TH control (Brown et al., 1988; Liu and Chan, 2002). Many fish species have a swim bladder which is a gas-filled organ that typically consists of two chambers (Robertson et al., 2007). The posterior chamber inflates during early development in the embryonic phase, while the anterior chamber inflates during late development in the larval phase. Both the posterior and the anterior chamber have an important role in regulating buoyancy, and the anterior chamber has an additional role in hearing (Robertson et al., 2007).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis AOP describes how inhibition of TPO results in decreased synthesis of THs in the thyroid follicles. This reduces the availability of T4 for conversion to the more biologically active T3. Reduced T3 levels prohibit normal inflation of the anterior swim bladder chamber. Due to its role in regulating buoyancy, this results in reduced swimming performance. Since reduced swimming performance results in a decreased ability to forage and avoid predators, this reduces chances of survival. The final adverse outcome is a decrease of the population growth rate. Since many AOPs eventually lead to this more general adverse outcome at the population level, the more specific and informative adverse outcome at the organismal level, increased mortality, is used in the AOP title. Support for this AOP is mainly based on chemical exposures in zebrafish and fathead minnows (Nelson et al., 2016; Godfrey et al., 2017; Stinckens et al., 2016, 2020). Convincing evidence comes from a TPO knockout study in zebrafish confirming that anterior inflation was reduced (Fang et al. 2022). Additional evidence of a link between reduced TH synthesis and reduced anterior chamber inflation is available from a study where a mutation was inserted in the gene coding for dual oxidase, another enzyme that is important for TH synthesis since it provides hydrogen peroxide for iodide oxidation (Chopra et al., 2019).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis AOP is part of a larger AOP network describing how decreased synthesis and/or decreased biological activation of THs leads to incomplete or improper inflation of the swim bladder, leading to reduced swimming performance, increased mortality and decreased population trajectory (Knapen et al., 2018; Knapen et al., 2020; Villeneuve et al., 2018). Apart from the upstream part, the current AOP is identical to the corresponding AOPs leading from DIO1 and DIO2 inhibition to increased mortality via anterior swim bladder inflation (\u003ca href=\"https://aopwiki.org/aops/156\"\u003ehttps://aopwiki.org/aops/156\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://aopwiki.org/aops/158\"\u003ehttps://aopwiki.org/aops/158\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":102,"created_at":"2014-01-23T11:09:25.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-06-22T10:29:09.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/159.json"},{"id":347,"title":"Toll-like receptor 4 activation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma inactivation leading to pulmonary fibrosis","short_name":"TLR4 activation, PPAR gamma activation and Pulmonary fibrosis","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":286,"created_at":"2015-09-07T04:17:35.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T09:42:59.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/347.json"},{"id":316,"title":"Trypsin inhibition leading to pancreatic acinar cell tumors","short_name":"TI-induced AC tumors","abstract":"\u003cp\u003ePancreatic exocrine secretion is controlled mainly by the gastrointestinal hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which is secreted by CCK-producing I cells located in the mucosa of the small intestine. Once the contents in the stomach is transported to the small intestine, I cells are stimulated to release CCK into the bloodstream. Several mechanisms to stimulate CCK release are involved.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn rats, pancreatic acinar cells secrete monitor peptide (MP) into the intestinal lumen as a pancreatic soluble trypsin inhibitor (TI). MP stimulates I cells to release CCK into the bloodstream through their surface MP receptors. Then, the increased blood concentration of CCK induces pancreatic exocrine secretion. When fasting, trypsin\u0026ndash;MP complexes are formed to decrease the level of free MP in the small intestinal lumen; thereafter, CCK release is suppressed. Meanwhile, upon feeding, partially ingested proteins in the diet consume trypsin to increase the luminal concentration of free MP followed by stimulation of CCK release.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhen soybean powder (raw soya flour) containing trypsin inhibitory molecules or TIs such as camostat are given to rats, the intestinal concentration of free MP is increased due to trypsin\u0026ndash;TI complex formation. Then, intestinal I cells are stimulated to release CCK. The resulting increased blood level of CCK stimulates pancreatic exocrine secretion of MP, which induces further CCK release via a positive feedback loop. A sustained increase in the CCK level might induce pancreatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia and ultimately result in acinar cell tumor formation.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis increased blood CCK level induced by trypsin inhibition may also occur in humans and other mammalian species including rats. Luminal CCK-releasing factors (LCRFs) are trypsin-sensitive peptides secreted from small intestinal mucosa that stimulate CCK release by intestinal I cells. Luminal levels of LCRFs are increased after TI ingestion; however, the resultant increase in CCK levels does not stimulate further release of LCRFs, in contrast to MP.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSpecies differences in CCK-mediated stimulation of pancreatic enzyme secretion have been described in rats and humans. In rats, CCK stimulates pancreatic exocrine secretion and/or proliferation directly via CCK1 receptors expressed on acinar cell surfaces or indirectly via vagal afferent nerves expressing CCK1 receptors, especially at physiological blood CCK concentrations. In contrast to rats, the secretory function of human pancreatic acinar cells is indirectly innervated by vagal afferent nerves expressing CCK1 receptors; however, CCK receptors (mainly CCK2 receptors) expressed on human acinar cell surfaces are not involved in both exocrine secretion and proliferation. These findings suggest that, in humans, innervation of acinar cells in response to elevated CCK blood levels affects mainly secretory functions, with less of an effect on cell proliferation, although the effects of vagal stimulation on acinar cell proliferation are still unclear.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, long-term administration of TIs induces pancreatic acinar cell tumors in rats. The main factor contributing to carcinogenesis is a sustained increase in plasma CCK levels mediated by an increased luminal concentration of trypsin-sensitive MP.

Developmental exposure of rats to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) results in a low-frequency hearing loss in adult offspring (Goldey et al., 1995a; Herr et al., 1996; 2001; Crofton and Rice, 1999; Laskey et al., 2002). A body of work now supports the hypothesis that this ototoxicity results from PCB-induced hypothyroxinemia during a critical period of auditory development. Evidence for this hypothesis includes: a correlation between the severity of functional auditory impairment and the degree of thyroid hormone depletion (Goldey et al., 1995a; 1995b; Goldey and Crofton, 1998; Crofton, 2004), a cross-fostering study demonstrating that the critical exposure period is postnatal (Crofton et al., 2000a), and amelioration of the hearing loss following postnatal thyroxine replacement (Goldey and Crofton, 1998).

One type of irritation, corrosive irritation causes inflammation from tissue destruction and appears to be limited to inhalation of industrial chemicals for example hydrochloric acid, chlorine gas, and ammonia. The second type, sensory irritation is caused by sensory stimulation mediated by activation of specific receptors located in the trigeminal nerve endings and occurs at concentrations that do not result in tissue destruction. Our focus is to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) for sensory irritants. \u0026nbsp;Many inhalable chemicals are sensory irritants (Alarie et al 1966, 1973, Schaper et al., 1993) that can cause physiological responses including pain, mucus production, nasal obstruction, sneezing, coughing, and decreases in respiration rate (Brunning et al., 2014). The target organ of respiratory irritants is ultimately the airways causing inflammation of the trachea, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. A receptor present in the upper airways is the TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1) that induces a physiological response to make the subject aware of the presence of chemicals and initiate several defensive biological responses. A wide range of chemicals activates TRPA1 (Bessac and Jordt, 2010). The activation of TRPA1 acts as a gatekeeper of inflammation/irritation and is a critical endpoint in the regulation of exposure to volatile organic chemicals (Bautista et al., 2013; Lehman et al., 2015).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":160,"created_at":"2016-06-28T11:29:58.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T09:39:44.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/196.json"},{"id":182,"title":"Weather event contributes abnormal foraging leading to colony loss/failure","short_name":"Weather to abnormal foraging to colony loss/failure","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":198,"created_at":"2014-01-14T10:26:18.000-05:00","updated_at":"2024-03-06T12:25:45.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/182.json"},{"id":181,"title":"Weather event contributes to colony loss/failure","short_name":"Weather to colony loss/failure","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":198,"created_at":"2014-01-14T10:26:18.000-05:00","updated_at":"2024-03-06T12:25:45.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/181.json"},{"id":73,"title":"Xenobiotic Inhibition of Dopamine-beta-Hydroxylase and subsequent reduced fecundity","short_name":"DBH inhibition","abstract":"","corresponding_author":{"id":290,"created_at":"2015-03-16T15:56:10.000-04:00","updated_at":"2021-04-13T09:39:50.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/73.json"},{"id":280,"title":"α-diketone-induced bronchiolitis obliterans","short_name":"α-diketone-induced bronchiolitis obliterans","abstract":"\u003cp\u003eBronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a severe respiratory illness due to the obstruction of the smallest airways of the lungs, the bronchioles. Inhalation of the -diketone diacetyl has been associated with the development of this disease in employees of the microwave popcorn production industry. Exposure of laboratory animals to diacetyl as well as other \u0026alpha;-diketones results in airway epithelial injury, ultimately resulting in BO-like lesions. The electrophilic \u0026alpha;-diketones interact with arginine residues causing altered structure and functioning of proteins. However, the critical proteins causing the observed toxicity have not yet been identified. Upon severe or repeated exposure to \u0026alpha;-diketones the epithelium of the airways becomes severely damaged or the airways become completely denuded. In these injured regions of the airways the intrinsic regenerative capacity of the epithelium, via proliferation of basal cells and subsequent differentiation, is lost. This leads to compensatory proliferation in the adjacent mesenchyme in which fibroblast to myofibroblast transition may take place under the influence of inflammatory signals. Another possible cause of fibrogenesis is through the occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) within the injured airway epithelium. Excessive proliferation of fibrotic cells leads to the occlusion of the bronchioles resulting in dry cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and a strongly reduced lung function, the symptoms of BO.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis AOP is linked to EU-ToxRisk case study \u0026ldquo; RDT: Popcorn Lung \u0026ndash; read-across on diketones\u0026rdquo; in which the effects of \u0026alpha;-diketone exposures are investigated using ex-vivo human precision cut lung slices and primary human bronchial epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid interface.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","corresponding_author":{"id":410,"created_at":"2017-03-10T05:23:56.000-05:00","updated_at":"2023-12-11T05:22:36.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":true},"url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/280.json"}]
